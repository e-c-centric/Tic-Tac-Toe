# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Java implementation of the TicTacToe game, with an "expandable" board, 
i.e. the board size can be set to any positive integer greater than 3,
and the normal rules of the game will apply.

A player can win by placing all their tokens in a straight line in a board diagonal, row, or column.
